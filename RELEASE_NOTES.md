## Version 2.0-rc1
* `RxTxComm` has been successfully replaced with `jSerialComm` and tested with RTU
* The whole codebase has been re-vamped to use modern constructs and practises, not a single class has remained untouched
* Codebase is compatible with JDK 1.6

* A logging framework (log4j) has been included with a wrapper to improve performance and allow token passing
* We have some tests!! Unit tests have been added for all automation friendly protocols (UDP and TCP)
* Unit tests have been added that independently verify the j2mod TCP Slave functionality
* Threading and concurrency has been hugely improved - removed synchronisation errors and corrected the handling of thread shutdown
* Brought some sanity to the Facade package so that it is now usable in a production setting
* Removed the serial BIN transport - it was proprietary and not taken up by any hardware vendors that I could find
* Fixed the UDP transport for both Master and Slave so that it is some way approaching robust

* Build system incorporates GPG signing and is compatible with one-click deployment to Maven Central through Sonatype

## Version 2.0-rc2
* Added ability to specify timeout for Facade classes `ModbusTCPMaster`, `ModbusUDPMaster` and `ModbusSerialMaster`

## Version 2.4.0

## Version 2.5.1
##### _Note:- v2.5.1 is not backwards compatible with v2.5.0_
Some changes may be required for applications using this version. The changes bellow detail where a non-compatible change has been made.
* Removed the deprecated `ModbusCoupler` implementation - users should switch their code to use `SlaveFactory` and apply their `ProcessImage` instances to the slave directly
The new implementation means that `ProcessImage` is not coupled to a slave and can be shared across slaves and unit IDs
_(**NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE**)_
* Added a method `getError` to `ModbusSlave` to enable users to get any startup errors after a slave is opened #72
* Fixed the issue whereby serial slaves will respond with error messages for requests that are targeted for them #62
* Updated the documentation and byline
* Moved the useRtuOverTcp flag to constructor #75
_(**NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE**)_

* Fixed Error in ReadInputDiscretesRequest class SetBitCount() method. Can't access the last address. #87

## Version 2.5.2
